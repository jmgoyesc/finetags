# finetags

**finetags** is a Kotlin + Spring Boot backend that extracts transactions from PDF bank statements. Users can upload files, view parsed data, and define custom tags to organize expensesâ€”ideal for preparing personal tax reports in Germany.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload PDF bank statements (local only)
- Extract structured transaction data (date, reference, value, type)
- Track processing status per file
- Query extracted data by process ID
- Fully in-memory (no persistence)
- Designed for easy expansion to tagging, aggregation, and AWS deployment

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** + **Spring Boot** (REST API)
- **Apache PDFBox** (PDF text extraction)
- **In-memory storage** (no database)
- JSON-based REST communication

---
